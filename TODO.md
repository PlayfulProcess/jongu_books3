# To Do List for JonguBooks

## ðŸ§¹ Clean Up
- [ ] Clean up the export buttons (PDF, eBook, Share Online) that are not working or are placeholders.

## ðŸ¤– AI Improvements
- [ ] When generating characters with AI, prompt the user to create an initial story description if they haven't provided one yet.
- [ ] Try to create image consistency across the pages (e.g., by passing a style or character description to each image prompt, or using a seed if supported).
- [ ] Pass the full story context object to all AI calls in the backend (for richer, context-aware generation).
- [ ] Implement multi-turn image editing using OpenAI's new multi-turn editing API (for refining images across multiple turns).
