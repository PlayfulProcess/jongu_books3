## ðŸŽ¨ Add DALL-E integration for page illustrations

- [ ] Research and possibly implement other DALL-E character consistency techniques (reference images, grid prompts, seed/variation, etc)
- [ ] Sidebar UI: Use the same font as the main website, and replace sidebar icons with purple step circles (matching the main content step style)
- [ ] Continue polishing sidebar spacing, alignment, and hover/active states for a modern, unified look
- [ ] Try to create image consistency across the pages (e.g., by passing a style or character description to each image prompt, or using a seed if supported).
